# Toilet-Odor-Detector-and-Alarm-system-using-MQ137-sensor-with-EEPROM-calibration-and-web-server
This project is an **odor detection and alarm system** for toilets, utilizing an **MQ137 gas sensor** to monitor ammonia (NHâ‚ƒ) levels. The system uses **EEPROM for calibration storage**, **serial communication** for user inputs, and a **web server** to monitor the odor status remotely.
